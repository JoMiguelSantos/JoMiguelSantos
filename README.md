- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoMiguelSantos
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to Software Development and Data (including Machine Learning and NLP)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly Software Development topics as well as Deployment (AWS/Terraform) and Data Engineering/Management (setting up and managing SQL and NoSQL databases)  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects involving Sustainability and Renewable Energies as well as Space Ventures but also Data topics in general are of the utmost interest for me.
